# Automatic Armature


A robotic looking armature that moves (stepping forward and backwards) when someone approaches it, depending on how it is approached.


## Summary


The armature will be made out of wire, a breadboard, servo motors, an arduino, and wax, The breadboard will serve as it’s back, the arduino it’s front, and the servo motors is what will allow it to walk and move it’s arms back and forth. The light sensor will be on the figure’s back, as it will need to be connected to the breadboard. 

The programming would make it so that if there was too much rapid change in the light detection (too much movement from behind the figure) it would move forwards (away from the movement). Once that movement stops, the figure would step backwards.


## Component Parts


- At least 4 servos for the hips and shoulders
- Wax/Plastic/Wire for the actual armature (will build)
- Arduino (INPUT & OUTPUT)
- Breadboard (INPUT & OUTPUT)
- Light activated sensor(s) (INPUT)


## Challenges


The most difficult part may be making the sensor work the way U want it too, as I’ve greatly struggled with that before. I am also anticipating difficulties with making the head of the figure, as I want the expression to be able to speak on it’s own, and I don’t have a lot of face creating skills yet.


I also know that money will be a challenge, and I am unsure of exactly how much money I will need to spend on this project,

## Timeline


What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks?


Week 1: Write proposal, borrow equipment, gather photos to use for reference
Week 2: Collect all the parts, begin the figure
Week 3: Finish test, make adjustments, make bullet points for oral presentation
Week 4: Complete the figure (including servos within it), debug, write oral presentation
Week 5: Present!
